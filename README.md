# Recipebox

Structure:

- Directory holding each list.md, and directories for each meal category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Dessert) (divide BLD to mains and sides) in which meals will be organised
- if needed, add a drinks section
- Each recipe will need a "metadata/categorisation" section to include the sortable tags above, each should have a link to the homepage of the Recipebox at the top
- Each recipe should use a reasonably standardised template, To be developed
- Attribution for each recipe should be given as a subtitle of the title at the box
- DO I want to add date stamps?
- Will need subdirectories to hold sublists such as canada.md or easy.md
